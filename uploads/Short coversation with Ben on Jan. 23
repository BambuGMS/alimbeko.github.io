Short coversation with Ben on Jan. 23

Ben approached me regarding the rehearsal of XLP and explained why he was pissed and why he yelled at students earlier today. He stresses about the fact that most challenge designers are focusing on tasks and missing the big picture, they are not "actively learning" by means of "holding meetings and collecting digital assests". He also stresses that I should be the person to report to him when I feel that this is the case among challenge designers. I should tell him if i notice that challenge designers are not "actively learning" and tell him if I don't know whether I'm noticing such things. I suggested that since it is a recoccuring thing at EVERY XLP we held in the past, it might be reasonable to look at the fundamental design of the program and how challenge designers and task executors are selected and trained. Motivation I think is the biggest challenge; it is hard to find motivation when the vision is too ambiguous and explicit logic is not communicated. This I think is the case in the current state of XLP. It is considered as different things by different people and no concrete definition exists. Additionally told Ben I have been occupied with designing data collection procedures and the design of web publishing workflows, which, thanks to Ben firing guys from Xi'an, are also on tasks on my plate.
