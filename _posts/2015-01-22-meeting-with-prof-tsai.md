Today me and Guan Jingjing went to meet Prof. Tsai at Beihang University. We discussed two topics: *preparation materials for XLP in San Francisco in April* and *the program evaluation framework*.

###San Francisco XLP:

**Date:** April 2-4
**Fees:** Approx. $400
**Target audience:** 2nd/3rd year undergraduate students

Need to provide:

 - Application/survey
	 - We need to make the application process more culturally  appropriate for American students:
		 -  Remove sensitive questions re: ID numbers
		 - Include only	name, address,  email, phone, gpa
	 - XLP Introduction paragraph


###Program evaluation


- Logic model can be displayed at the event
- Consider introducing a control group
- Follow up with participants after few months
- Document the current evaluation procedures to provide templates for future programs
- Have a general Logic Model as a template and more specific for each event
- Write possible theories for each metrics
	- examples:
		- students with higher motivation tend to perform better
		- teams with higher collaboration tend to do better
		- teams with higher use of technology tend to do better
		- more interactions result in higher creativity
		- law theories
- Develop interpretations after data collection
- Include questions re: what aspects participants liked/disliked the most about the event
- Use the moving slider instead of likert scale to get continuous responses
