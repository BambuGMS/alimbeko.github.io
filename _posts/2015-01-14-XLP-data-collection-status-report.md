According to Ben's feedback, I am using the relationship between four stages of the activity and the four forces of learning. These are as follows:

1. Early success - contributed to Technology
2. Fail early, fail safe - Law (idea of reward-punishment)
3. Convergence - Market (a platform for interaction)
4. Demonstration - Culture/Social Norms (A way of convening the message)


#### 1. Early success/Technology
Last survey already established a relationship between overall team performance and their technical abilities. I am thinking of adding questions where the teams can indicate which tools they are using and at what scale (e.g. 1 Never - 7 Extensively), then we can compare it to their actual performance. The question here is to determine which technologies are the participants learning and using, and which they may not learning, or learning, but not using.

Sample questions:
- Please list the technological tools (software, hardware) you are using in your project
- On the scale from 1-7, please indicate how frequent do you use each tool.
- On the scale from 1-7, please indicate how critical is each tool to your project.




####2. Fail early, fail safe/Law
Most frequent causes of failure in this stage include lack of basic procedures, for things such as effective meetings, conflict resolutions etc. The resources including these procedures will be provided to the participants. Here I propose to test the first statement and see if the early failures result in better performance in the long-run.

Sample questions:
- On the scale from 1-7, how familiar are you with effective meeting procedures, such as Robert's Rule of Order
- On the scale from 1-7, how often have you used these procedures in your team meetings
- On the scale from 1-7, how familiar are you with the XLP court system
- On the scale from 1-7, how often have you used the court's services to resolve conflicts

####3. Convergence/Market
This relationship is not as explicit as others. Convergence implies collaboration and interactions between teams to work to a common goal. Market provides the monetary instrument to mediate these interactions. Given that we will have team merging stages, I think market force should move the merging teams to find a way to adjust their inter-team funds. I am not clear yet how can this be incorporated in the survey. However, I think we can get the necessary data also from the market transactions.


####4. Demonstration/Social norms
This stage deals with the actual presentation of the results. Social Norms/Culture is enforced by the community. The community in this case are the learners, participants, Challenge Designers and Mission Executors. Given that the demonstration of results (media presentations, rituals) follow certain social norms, the public reception can be enhanced. The subject I think is quite wide with a lot of factors and I am yet to figure under which ones would be best to use.


Prof. Tsai also mentioned the moving targets approach and also the relationship between Challenge Designers and Mission Executors. I think the moving targets approach can be a good performance indicator along with others. I think this can be best implemented with the use of DPC Dynamic Project Control tool, but for the short-term, I am planning to obtain a complete challenge list and develop a workflow to get teams report on their status, so we can have something like a GANTT chart in the end. Once I have the list I will design a feedback form for participants to reflect on each challenge and their directions.

Regarding the Challenge Designers I am designing a workflow for them to report their status before and during the activity. The more dynamic this workflow is, the faster we can identify the problems and trends during the event.
