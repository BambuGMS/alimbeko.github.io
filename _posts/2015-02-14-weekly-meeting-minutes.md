Meeting Minutes

 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

 - XLP Evaluation Framework
	 - This past week I have worked with Prof. Tsai on finishing the conference paper and the presentation slides with the results of the January XLP. Most of our communication went over email with Ben being copied on all of them, so I assume Ben is aware of this. The latest draft has been emailed today to prof. Tsai and Ben as well, which should be submitted today after further edits by Prof. Tsai. Also Fei Shi, an educational researcher who participated in XLP evaluation in the past reached out to me to see if she could look at the XLP assessment results. I haven't shared the work since it was still incomplete.


**FEEDBACK **
