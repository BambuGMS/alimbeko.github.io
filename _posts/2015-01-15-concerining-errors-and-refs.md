## part i: errors in my analysis##

Okay, I did basic errors when calculating correlations (it's been a long time since I had to do statistics). So basically I have based my last statements (as shown below) on false assumptions. 

> Last survey already established a relationship between overall team performance and their technical abilities.

The problem was that I looked at Mean Values of the variables I had for interaction and performance and my graph looked like this:

But I needed to use the Actual Values to test the correlation, so  my graph should've looked like this:

Yep, that doesn't look too good. I found this error once I actually started analyzing each variable in SPSS and received a number of scatter plot charts that looked like this:

Obviously, we cannot observe any trends, and SPSS further confirmed my error by returning low correlation coefficients for all the variables (max: 0.4). [NOTE: Even though for Pearsons correlation, the assumption of bivariate data normality wasn't met, and without visible monotonic relationship, I couldn't use Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation, I still went ahead and tested it. Not sure how this affects the coefficients, but I still highly doubt the correlation given the plots.]

## part ii: the refs ##

Regarding the new survey, prof. Tsai suggested to refer to his earlier papers from IEEE Trans. on Education, which are the following:

 - [Cloud-Based Virtual Laboratory for Network Security Education (2014)](http://alimbeko.github.io/uploads/IEEE-tsai-2014.pdf)
 - [Collaborative Learning Using Wiki Web Sites for Computer Science Undergraduate Education: A Case Study](http://alimbeko.github.io/uploads/IEEE-tsai-2011.pdf)

Both papers provide learning metrics and factors, which can be also used in our case. I am currently in process of developing new hypotheses and research questions based in these papers and our previous work. More updates to come soon!
