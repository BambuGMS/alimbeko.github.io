 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

 - Data analysis updates
	 - Over past couple days I finished collecting data from blogs and Teambition. Right now I am organizing the digital data including data from Git, according to each participant in a single database using SPSS.
	 - I am concurrently running statistical analyses in SPSS on both survey and digital data. So far I found a few statistically significant correlations that I think can be used in the paper. I will summarize the results and send out the preliminary analysis tables tonight to you and Prof. Tsai for review. Once I get feedback I will start incorporating the results in the draft paper that I have sent out last night.
	 - For the blogs I have translated them into English and created word clouds in English to identify the most common topics. Since I cannot do a very thorough qualitative analysis based on the online translation, which might be incorrect, I think word cloud is at least something for now. Here is a cloud for the 1st day blogs from Toyhouse.cc:

	- Most data can be found on the CDT repository on GitCafe. 




- SF updates
	- Discussed with Woody the requirements for the website and what needs to be done for San Francisco event. Agreed to set up a Teambition project and the group chat for communicating with Ben and WisdomGarden.




**FEEDBACK **
 
 *10 Minutes: Professor's feedback regarding student's current progress.*
 
 - Data analysis updates

**OPEN BUSINESS**

*10 Minutes: Open discussion of current and future business*

- WisdomGarden never drafted the non-disclosure form I suppose. Their data analysis in the report is not very comprehensive, with last couple diagrams being based on assumed data. I think with full data they might be able to provide assistance in designing the platform for automatic processing of the data in future.
