Here is my summary of what I have done over the past week as we have conducted the XLP at Tsinghua.
Also some comments about XLP in San Francisco.

**THU XLP Data Report:**

The data collection has been organized throughout the 4 days of the event, which included 4 surveys for Mission Executors and 1 survey for Challenge Designers. We had over 100 questions for Mission Executors and they go according to our Factors Table designed last week. The response rates were as follows:

- Pre-event survey: 30 out of 36 responses
- Survey after teams 1st merge: 32 out of 35 responses (1 participant quit)
- Survey after teams 2nd merge: 34 out of 35 responses
- Post-event survey: 29 out of 35 responses
- CD survey: 10 out of 25, still open.

Further we have digital records from different departments. Here is a short overview of the event in numbers:

- 108 blog posts on Toyhouse.cc including participants summaries and reflections, 
- 496 commits on the Git repository made by 51 contributors, 
- 387 tasks on Teambition (with 341 tasks marked as complete), 
- 153 recorded monetary transactions
 - 6 black market transactions
 - 84 transactions related to the Bank (loan/deposit)
 - 36 transactions between Mission Executors and the Market services provided by Challenge Designers
 - 30 transactions among Mission Executors
- 1 court trial, 2 settlements without a trial, 
- 5 patent applications, 1 trademark application and 3 charges of IP infringement, 
- 13 registered companies.

I am currently in the process of exporting and formating all the data in the similar structure so I could run some analyses. As you can see there is a lot of data, so it is taking some time. So for example, the data extraction from Teambition and Toyhouse.cc has to be done manually as I have no other way as of now. The language might be another problem for translating the blogs; I am using Google Translate for now with further corrections of my own to avoid awkward translations.

Once I get all the data in order in next couple days I will begin writing the draft paper which Prof. Tsai wants to give to Dorina for evaluation. We can continuously revise the paper as I analyse the data and finalize the theories. I'm hoping to write up the first draft in the next week or two.

**Other comments regarding the event:**

We have set up a website at [toyhouse-xlp.gitcafe.io](toyhouse-xlp.gitcafe.io) before the event to allow participants to publish their work on it using Git Pages tool. Unfortunately, even though me and Zhang Hang personally informed and trained several teams about this platform, in the end they didn't publish their teams work. Although, the final version of the constitution was published on this website, but again they didn't care about mentioning about it in their final presentations. The website has Google Analytics set up for tracking activity and initially that's how we planned to measure their work by seeing how many visits it gets. Anyways, I think this platform can still be used for future events, as long as it is clearly specified in the requirements.

The final part (Demonstration) seemed to lack quality, where many presentations were just bad and lacked aesthetics. I cannot say much about the quality of their content in the presentation, since I didn't understand most of it, but again it didn't move me much and the microphone feedback was annoying. 

Most participants had suggestions on improving certain mechanisms related to 4 forces and majority of participants in the survey expressed a will to join future XLP events as Challenge Designers to implement their suggestions. This can be a good way to recruit future CDs.

**XLP in SF:**

Regarding this event, I agree with Prof. Tsai's points. As I mentioned before, for me it seems very unlikely that a 2-3 day experimental course will attract American college students IF they have to pay $300 for it. For college students it is A LOT of money (think student loans). Hence, I do agree that sponsorship is essential for this event, unless we target not just students, but let's say 'young professionals' with some level of income. 

Regarding the publicity and promotion I think we need to make sure that the course description is clear on what participants will be working on in this particular event. This will avoid confusion and failure to meet applicants expectations (esp. if we charge fees, this can become a legal issue).

Also I will not be able to travel to SF for this event due to passport renewal still in process (might take 3-4 months before I get my new passport).
