##This my first learning log for 2015.

In the past couple weeks, many things happened. First and foremost, we flew out to Xi'an to organise the XLP at Eurasia University. I have collected initial demographics information before the event, and also conducted data collection during the event through participant questionnaires conducted at 3 stages. I will discuss them more in detail later. Second thing was the planning of the next XLP event in late January at Tsinghua.

Now let's take a closer look at the details of the Xi'an event. The initial idea was to introduce several teams to Ungit modified to fit the Chinese users, and test the hypothesis on whether a localised graphic UI would have impact on these teams' performances. However, that was the biggest challenge as Ungit installations for selected teams failed due to a number of reasons. Here is a list of potential causes of failure:

* System and/or registry errors, which prevented successful Node.JS installation;
* Slow Internet connection and/or blocked access to the NPM public library and GitHub;
* Incompatible web browser;
* Very low processing capacity of the CPU.

Thus, the data collected doesn't reflect the usage of any Git UI of any sort except for the command line tool. From the collected data right away I was able to see several trends.

First, the collaboration levels on average increased when the teams merged in 3 large groups, but then dropped after merging into 1 team. This might give an insight on the scalability of the activities, with bigger teams presenting a challenge for certain individuals to contribute. Overall we observed that over 3 days respondents reported improved Git skill levels and increased level of conflicts (which could also be linked with the size of teams gradually increasing).

Second, a positive correlation was observed between average collaboration levels and average Git levels. That means, that respondents who reported higher skill levels in Git also reported higher collaboration levels. This trend prevails within all metrics used to evaluate collaboration level (Awareness, Trust, Competence, Shared Identity, Coordination, Performance, Conflict). It gives us an initial hint on whether mastering Git can actually affect the team dynamics and could back up our hypothesis (which is yet to be tested) that the localised GUI can increase collaboration.

Moving on to the planning of the January XLP, we are facing similar challenges we faced in Xi'an. One of the main issues in Xi'an was that majority of participants still didn't know how to use Git after 3 days. Several factors resulted in that, including lack of insightful organised training sessions, lack of awareness of participants about the provided training tools and materials, and the lack of communicating the actual importance and value of using Git as a digital publishing workflow tool versus other alternatives. For the January event, these issues need to be fixed so the plan is to design and prepare a better and more insightful Git training session.

Another challenge is to make all the interactions between participants to be recorded digitally. There are several ways we get them to do that already, like using bitcoins and keeping blogs, however, when it comes to actual work they do on Git, participants usually tend to work colocally within their teams and don't see the importance of recording their changes. My proposal is to make changes to the organisation of teams during the activities by changing the collocated team model to partially distributed team (PDT) model. The proposed model for the January event is described next.

We will have 40 participants and the initial plan is to split them in 8 teams of 5 people and later merge 8 teams in 4 teams, and then finally merge into 1 team. Usually we would let the 8 teams sit together and work on their own regarding their stories and planning for the constitution. Instead, I propose to set up 5 areas for 8 people each. We will locate 8 participants from different teams at each area, that way no 2 people from the same team are at the same area. Participants will be asked to collaborate with their team members electronically and we will also provide some face-to-face discussion times. Within their areas they can freely interact with other participants from different teams, but are discouraged to gather within their teams for extended periods of time. I am yet to come up with a specific mechanism how this can be best implemented, but I believe the physical distance between the team members will actually push each member to contribute as it will be more difficult to hide behind other member's work, while still provide an ability to learn from their peers who are not on their team.

This coming week me and the Challenge Designer Team will work on defining this possible model and also start to prepare and rehearse the XLP activities, including testing the digital publishing process by actually writing the Constitution for XLP using distributed workflow.

Happy New Year!
