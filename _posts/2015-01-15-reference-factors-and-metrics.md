Here I will list some materials relevant to the evaluation of XLP.

----------

####Reports####

 - [Framework for Evaluating Impacts of Informal Science Education Projects Report from a National Science Foundation Workshop](http://informalscience.org/documents/Eval_Framework.pdf) - really insightful report regarding the evaluation procedures with useful examples
 - [Principal Investigator’s Guide: Managing Evaluation in Informal STEM Education Projects](http://informalscience.org/documents/CAISEVSAPI_guide.pdf) - Comprehensive guide, chapters 4 (collaboration) & 5 (evaluation plan) are useful in particular.

#### Six-Factor Pedagogical Model for Experiment Evaluation and Grading####
This is a table from Prof. Tsai's paper on [CLOUD-BASED VIRTUAL LABORATORY FOR NETWORK SECURITY EDUCATION](http://alimbeko.github.io/uploads/IEEE-tsai-2014.pdf)


| Factors		| Experiment Elements           | Evaluation Methods|
| ------------- |:-------------|:-----|
| Motivation      | Goals & Usefulness of experiments | Student Survey|
||Tutorials, demos and samples|Student Feedback|
|| Fair grading criteria and bonus points|Student survey|
| Knowledge      | Background and factual knowledge|   Quiz and exams|
||Setup and configure experimental environments|Checked by TA
|| Perform and practice experiment tasks|Assignments and projects
||Experiment results verification and validation|Peer-evaluation|
| Collaboration | Teamwork in group experiments      |    Peer-evaluation within group|
||Knowledge sharing and discussion participation on V-Lab wiki and social sites| Grading on knowledge contribution, peer-evaluation
|Creativity| Innovative approaches for experiment tasks|Instructor grading, peer-evaluation
||Composition of research surveys and articles|Instructor grading
|Demonstration|Documentation and presentation for experiment design and results|Grading
||Demonstration in class|Grading, peer-evaluation
|Feedback|Platform and curriculum feedback|Student survey, online discussion
||Instructor and TA feedback|student survey


####Class Design Factors####
This is an excerpt from Prof. Tsai's paper [COLLABORATIVE LEARNING USING WIKI WEB SITES FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION: A CASE STUDY](http://alimbeko.github.io/uploads/IEEE-tsai-2011.pdf)

----------


> This paper identifies six learning factors relevant for wiki Web site development in an undergraduate class. A table with a detailed description of these factors is available at
http://asusrl.eas.asu.edu/cse360/Factor.htm. Briefly, these factors are the following.
> 
> 
> • **Knowledge base:** Students should contribute relevant and useful materials pertinent to the class. Fellow students and instructors should find these materials useful, educational, and even entertaining. Knowledge may include principles, practices, technologies, history, photographs, and graphs. The key evaluation criteria are relevancy and correctness of contents.
> 
> 
> • **Motivation:** Motivation for the class comes from the students’ own interest in the material, their receiving good grades for the assignments, and recognition from their
classmates, friends, teachers, and family. Students are allowed to choose relevant topics for their projects. This choice provides for a sense of ownership, which also adds to student motivation.
> 
> 
> • **Research (harnessing collective intelligence):** Students should be able to conduct semi-independent research in an undergraduate class, seeking materials beyond those
taught in the lectures and textbooks. Students should also select those materials that are most useful to the class. Students are provided with an initial set of suggested topics, or they can, with the instructor’s approval, choose a topic of interest to them. They can seek guidance from the teaching assistants and instructors during their research. Once they have their initial Web site completed, they will be given feedback by the instructor and fellow students so that they can improve their Web sites.
> 
> 
> • **Social aspects:** Students should be involved in this project in a socially friendly manner. This socialization is accomplished by having the students work in teams. Furthermore, the students need to perform peer evaluations of the materials developed by other teams. To encourage peer evaluation and collaboration, students need to cast their votes on the best Web site developed. The best Web sites will receive a grading bonus.
> 
> 
> • **Presentation:** Students should organize the materials on their Web sites in a logical manner; furthermore, students should be able to present their Web sites in front of fellow students in the classroom.
> 
> 
> • **Feedback and support:** Bidirectional feedback occurs between the teaching team and students. The teaching team provides feedback and suggestions to students as they perform research and assemble their wiki projects. Students also provide feedback on the difficulties and issues encountered. Furthermore, students provide feedback to fellow students by peer evaluation and ranking of the wiki Web sites. The student evaluation of the teaching team includes assessment of the effectiveness of the wiki Web sites for education and of the various activities and elements of the wiki projects including presentation, Web site design, and technical support.
